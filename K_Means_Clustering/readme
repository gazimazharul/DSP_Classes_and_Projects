In this project, fake data was generated using Faker. This dataset contains Name, Address, Email, Age, Salary, and Phone information. 
The K_means clustering model is used to cluster Age and Salary. Here, 10 clusters are used as the data was fake. MinMax scaler is used to
scale the age and salary data. Later, a scatter plot has been drawn to see the cluster. Finally, the Sum of squared error is calculated to \
find the elbow plot.
